//! What the hocus plugins say to each other.
//!
//! Message names are constants rather than string literals at each call site
//! because a typo in a pipe name is silent — the host delivers it, the target
//! matches nothing, and the sender waits forever.
//!
//! What is left here is the agent daemon's protocol and the shell-facing store
//! pipes. The store's own snapshot push is gone: projects and todos live in a
//! shared data-store namespace that every hocus plugin reads directly, so there
//! is nothing to replicate and nothing to keep in step.
