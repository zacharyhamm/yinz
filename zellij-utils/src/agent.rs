//! What an agent pane says about itself.
//!
//! A pane's agent record (`PaneInfo::agent`) is written by three roads: the spawn path, for a
//! pane a plugin opened as an agent pane; a plugin, through `PluginCommand::SetPaneAgent`; and
//! the agent's own hooks, through `zellij action agent-report --hook-json`. This module is the
//! reading of a Claude Code hook event that the third road needs, kept here so the binary and
//! the plugins that draw the result cannot drift apart.
